You are an expert technical recruiter and HR analyst.

Extract **all hard and soft skills** from the job description below.

Guidelines:
- Hard skills only contain the core skill name, it does not contain any extra tags like "(optional)", "(preferred)", "(or equivalent)", even if the LLM wants to “clarify” slashes or alternatives.
- If multiple skills are written with a slash "/", treat each skill as separate and do NOT add any "(optional)" or similar tags.
- If a skill is mentioned as part of a list of alternatives (e.g., "one of the following skills: Python, Java, C#, or C++"), extract **all listed skills** separately.
- Include as hard skills: programming languages, frameworks, libraries, tools, platforms, orchestration systems, cloud services, APIs, databases, and other technical competencies.
- Include soft skills such as teamwork, communication, leadership, adaptability, and problem-solving.
- Be exhaustive: better to include too many skills than too few.
- Return only valid JSON in this format:

{
  "hard_skills": ["example1", "example2"],
  "soft_skills": ["example1", "example2"]
}
