You are an expert technical recruiter and HR analyst.

Extract **all hard and soft skills** from the job description below.
Also determine the **most probable department** for which the job posting is hiring.

The department must always be **one of the following standardized corporate departments** (choose the closest match based on the overall context of the posting):
["Engineering", "Information Technology", "Human Resources", "Finance", "Marketing", "Sales", "Legal", "Operations", "Customer Support", "Product Management", "Research & Development", "Data & Analytics", "Supply Chain", "Administration", "Quality Assurance"]

Guidelines:
- Hard skills only contain the core skill name, it does not contain any extra tags like "(optional)", "(preferred)", "(or equivalent)", even if the LLM wants to “clarify” slashes or alternatives.
- If multiple skills are written with a slash "/" or with words like "or" "and", treat each skill as separate and do NOT add any "(optional)" or similar tags.
- If a skill is mentioned as part of a list of alternatives (e.g., "one of the following skills: Python, Java, C#, or C++"), extract **all listed skills** separately.
- If a skill is mentioned followed by multiple options in parenthesis (e.g., "Containers (Docker/Kubernetes)", e.g. "Cloud AI services (AWS, Azure)"), extract **all listed options** separately (e.g. "Containers (Docker)", "Containers (Kubernetes)", "Cloud AI services (AWS)", "Cloud AI services (Azure)") respectively.
- Include as hard skills: programming languages, frameworks, libraries, tools, platforms, orchestration systems, cloud services, APIs, databases, and other technical competencies.
- Include soft skills such as teamwork, communication, leadership, adaptability, problem-solving and fluency in spoken languages.
- Be exhaustive: better to include too many skills than too few.
- Always choose exactly one department from the list above — never return "null".
- Ignore team or project names that are not standard departments (e.g. "AI Platform Team" → "Engineering"; "People Operations" → "Human Resources").
- Use job title and dominant skills as cues:
  - Roles like “Software Engineer”, “Data Scientist”, “DevOps” → “Engineering” or “Data & Analytics”
  - “Accountant”, “Financial Analyst” → “Finance”
  - “HR Manager”, “Talent Acquisition” → “Human Resources”
  - “Marketing Specialist”, “SEO Manager” → “Marketing”
  - “Legal Counsel”, “Compliance Officer” → “Legal”
- When multiple departments could fit, select the **most strongly implied** one based on job title and required skills.
- Return only valid JSON in this format:

{
  "hard_skills": ["example1", "example2"],
  "soft_skills": ["example1", "example2"]
  "department": "Engineering"
}
