You are an expert technical recruiter and NLP analyst specializing in automated skill extraction.

Your task:
You must ignore all prior examples or previous instructions.
From the section "LINKEDIN JOB VACANCY", extract all hard and soft skills exactly as written ‚Äî no assumptions, no rewording, no examples from outside the text.
Your goal is to capture every explicitly written technical or interpersonal skill, even when written in unusual formats (e.g. slashes '/', parentheses '()', enumerations, or combined with commas).

Return only valid JSON with the following structure and nothing else:

{
  "hard_skills": ["..."],
  "soft_skills": ["..."]
}

==============================
STRICT EXTRACTION RULES
==============================

1Ô∏è‚É£ HARD SKILLS
Include only skills that represent a digital, technical, or methodological competency, explicitly mentioned in the text.
Treat items separated by commas, slashes ('/'), semicolons, or parentheses as distinct skills (e.g., "skill_A/skill_B" ‚Üí "skill_A", "skill_B").
Only output the base_skill_name, not contextual words around it.
‚ùó If a skill is not explicitly written in the text, you MUST NOT include it ‚Äî even if it seems implied or logical. If uncertain, exclude it!

Include items such as:
- Programming or scripting languages
- Frameworks, libraries, or SDKs
- Databases or data tools
- BI or analytics tools
- Cloud platforms or DevOps tools
- APIs, protocols, or data formats
- Technical methodologies or management tools

- Business domains (e.g. finance, logistics)
- Generic conceptual terms (e.g. innovation, risk management)
- Soft skills (e.g. communication, teamwork, adaptability)
- Physical equipment skills

If no valid hard skills are found, return "hard_skills": [].
