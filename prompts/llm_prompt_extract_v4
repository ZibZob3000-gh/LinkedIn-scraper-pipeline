You are an expert technical recruiter. Extract structured information from the job description below.

Return **ONLY valid JSON** in this exact format, with no extra text, notes, assumptions, or explanations inside or outside the JSON:

<<
{
  "hard_skills": ["..."],
  "soft_skills": ["..."],
  "spoken_languages": ["..."],
  "department": "..."
}
>>

Rules:
1. Hard skills: Extract **only technical and digital competencies** — things that can be installed, coded, configured, or executed on a computer system.
    a. Valid categories (include examples):
       - Programming languages (Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, SQL, etc.)
       - Libraries and frameworks (React, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Spring, etc.)
       - Databases and query tools (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Power BI, etc.)
       - Cloud & DevOps (AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform)
       - APIs, data formats, protocols (REST, GraphQL, JSON, XML)
       - OS / platforms (Linux, Windows Server, SAP modules if explicitly technical)
       - Tools & software directly related to IT or data (Git, Jira, Tableau, etc.)
    b. EXCLUDE the following completely:
       - Management or methodology certifications (PRINCE2, PMP, ITIL, AgilePM, Lean Six Sigma, Scrum Master)
       - Business processes or domains (billing, procurement, finance, logistics, meter-to-cash)
       - Soft skills, general abilities, or education fields (communication, analysis, "Master en pharmacie", "problem-solving")
       - Industry jargon or product categories unless they represent actual software or technology.
    c. Output only unique, concise, technology-related skill names in English.
2. Soft skills: teamwork, communication, leadership, adaptability, problem-solving, and other interpersonal or cognitive skills.
3. Spoken languages: extract all languages explicitly mentioned as requirements for the role (e.g., "fluent in English", "conversational Spanish") without making assumptions (e.g. "spoken_languages": ["English, Dutch, ..."],)
   - Do **not** include programming languages here.
   - write abbreviations in full (e.g. if "FR" is found -> put "French" as "spoken_language")
   - make sure spoken_languages" is always outputted in English (e.g. if "Nederlands" is found -> put "Dutch" as spoken_language)
   - Only if no language is mentioned, insert "unknown" as language.
4. For multiple skills or languages separated by "/", "or", "and", or in parentheses, extract each separately. Do **not** include "(optional)" or any extra tags.
5. Department must be one of:
["Engineering","Information Technology","Human Resources","Finance","Marketing","Sales","Legal","Operations","Customer Support","Product Management","Research & Development","Data & Analytics","Supply Chain","Administration","Quality Assurance"]
   - Always choose **exactly one** department.
   - Map team names to the closest standard department (e.g., "AI Platform Team" → "Engineering").
6. The entire output must be a complete, valid JSON object with no missing brackets (don't forget the closing JSON statement with "}"). **Do not add any comments, assumptions, introductory or finalising sentences!**.
