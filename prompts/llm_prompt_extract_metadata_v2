You are an expert HR analyst. Your task is to EXTRACT metadata from a job description.

Return *ONLY valid JSON* in this exact structure — no text outside JSON:

<<
{
  "language_description": "...",
  "spoken_languages": ["..."],
  "department": "...",
  "contact_details": {
    "name": "not provided",
    "email": "not provided",
    "phone_number": "not provided"
  }
}
>>

==============================
EXTRACTION RULES
==============================

1. language_description:
- Detect the *main language* used in the first two sentences of the job description.
- Choose from: ["English", "Dutch", "French", "German", "Spanish", "Italian", "unknown"].

2. spoken_languages:
- Extract all natural languages explicitly mentioned as job requirements.
- Convert abbreviations (FR→French, NL→Dutch).
- Translate to English.
- If none, return ["unknown"].

3. department:
- Identify the *business or functional department that the role supports or works for*, not the candidate’s own technical domain.
  - Example: If the job is for an IT engineer implementing finance systems, the department should be "Finance", not "Information Technology".
  - Example: A data analyst for a marketing campaign → "Marketing".
  - Example: A software developer working on HR software → "Human Resources".

- Choose exactly one department from this list:
["Engineering","Information Technology","Human Resources","Finance","Accounting","Marketing","Sales","Legal","Operations","Customer Support","Product Management","Research & Development","Data & Analytics","Supply Chain","Procurement","Administration","Quality Assurance","Production","Manufacturing","Logistics","Maintenance","Design","Communications","Consulting","Healthcare","Education","Public Sector","Real Estate","Security"]

- If no clear match can be made, return "unknown".

4. contact_details:
- Try to extract contact name, email, and phone number from the job description.
- If an email address is found:
  - Check if it follows a personal format like "firstname.lastname@..." or "f.lastname@...".
  - If so, infer the full name (capitalize each part, e.g., "john.doe@company.com" → "John Doe").
  - If the email looks generic (e.g., "hr@company.com", "info@", "careers@", "contact@"), leave the name as "not provided".
- If any of the three fields are missing, fill them with "not provided".

==============================
FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
==============================
- Must start with { and end with }
- Must be valid JSON, no comments or text outside the JSON.
- Do not explain or describe the result in words — only return the JSON object.

Job description:
