You are an expert HR analyst. Your task is to EXTRACT metadata from a job description.

Return *ONLY valid JSON* in this exact structure — no text outside JSON:

<<
{
  "language_description": "...",
  "spoken_languages": ["..."],
  "department": "...",
  "contact_details": {
    "name": "not provided",
    "email": "not provided",
    "phone_number": "not provided"
  }
}
>>

==============================
EXTRACTION RULES
==============================

1. language_description:
- Detect the *main language* used in the first two sentences of the job description.
- Choose only from: ["English", "Dutch", "French", "German", "Spanish", "Italian", "unknown"].
- Return the single best match.

2. spoken_languages:
- Extract all natural languages mentioned *anywhere* in the description, including requirements like:
  "Fluent in English", "bilingual French/Dutch", "speaks German", etc.
- Recognize abbreviations (FR→French, NL→Dutch, EN→English, DE→German).
- Normalize to English names and avoid duplicates.
- If none are explicitly mentioned, return ["unknown"].
- Don't output languages that are not in the text.

3. department:
- Identify the *business or functional department that the role supports or works for*, not the candidate’s technical field.
  Examples:
    - IT engineer implementing finance systems → "Finance"
    - Data analyst for marketing campaigns → "Marketing"
    - Software developer working on HR software → "Human Resources"
    - Business consultant improving production efficiency → "Operations"
- Choose exactly ONE department from this fixed list:
  ["Engineering","Information Technology","Human Resources","Finance","Accounting","Marketing","Sales","Legal","Operations","Customer Support","Product Management","Research & Development","Data & Analytics","Supply Chain","Procurement","Administration","Quality Assurance","Production","Manufacturing","Logistics","Maintenance","Design","Communications","Consulting","Healthcare","Education","Public Sector","Real Estate","Security"]
- You MUST return one of these values only — if uncertain, return "unknown".
- Do NOT invent department names such as "Energy", "Department of Energy", etc.

4. contact_details:
- Extract name, email, and phone number from the ENTIRE job description (not just the end).
- If an email is found:
  - Check if it looks personal (e.g., "firstname.lastname@" or "f.lastname@").
  - If yes, infer the full name (capitalize properly, e.g., "john.doe@company.com" → "John Doe").
  - If generic (e.g., "hr@", "info@", "careers@", "contact@"), insert that email and leave name as "not provided".
- Return all three fields; if any are missing, fill the missing ones with "not provided".

==============================
FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
==============================
- Must start with { and end with }.
- Must be valid JSON — no comments, explanations, or text outside the JSON.
- Return only the JSON object.
